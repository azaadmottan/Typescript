# Typescript

## Introduction to Typescript

TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that compiles down to plain JavaScript. It was developed by Microsoft and has gained significant popularity, especially in large-scale JavaScript applications. TypeScript adds optional static types, interfaces, enums, and other features to JavaScript, which help developers catch errors early in the development process and write more maintainable code.

With TypeScript, you can define types for variables, function parameters, and return values. This helps prevent common errors and provides better tooling support, such as autocompletion and refactoring tools in modern code editors.

One of the key benefits of TypeScript is its ability to catch type-related errors during development, which can lead to more robust code and fewer bugs in production. Additionally, TypeScript integrates well with popular JavaScript libraries and frameworks like React, Angular, and Node.js.

Example

```javascript
    // Define a function that takes two parameters of type number and returns a number

    function add(x: number, y: number): number {

        return x + y;
    }

    // Define a variable of type number

    let result: number = add(3, 5);

    console.log(result); // Output: 8

```

In this example, TypeScript ensures that x and y are of type number, and it also ensures that the add function returns a number. If you were to pass a different type to add, TypeScript would raise a compilation error.
